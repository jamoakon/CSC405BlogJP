# Who and what were people listening to?

Let's compare how musical taste changed over the last three decades. Let's find who were the top 5 most popular artists in the 1990's, 2000's and 2010's, what their musical genres were, how popular and how many followers they have on spotify, and also some features about their music such as energy, danceability, speechiness and tempo.

## Let's start by authenticating

Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = '33b2241bc4b74388909a355ac19a9504')

access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

Pop, hip-hop and rap dominate the 2010's.

## How have audio features of the same genre evolved over the decades?

From the previous analysis, it is interesting to notice that pop was very popular in the 1990s but not so much in the 2000's. However, it made a strong comeback in the 2010's. Also, rap became one of the most popular genre in the 2000's and still very popular in the 2010's. How have these popular genres evolved across the decades?

let's compare the audio features between the pop genre of the 1990's and that of the 2010's. Let's select one of the most successful pop artist from each decade and compare the mean audio features of all of their songs.

### Pop

```{r}
pop_1990 <- get_artist_audio_features('mariah carey')

Pop_1990 <-
pop_1990 %>% 
    select(energy, danceability, speechiness, tempo) %>%
    summarize(mean_energy = mean(energy), 
              mean_danceability = mean(danceability),
              mean_speechiness = mean(speechiness),
              mean_tempo = mean(tempo)) %>% 
    mutate(years= "1990s")
```

```{r}
pop_2010 <- get_artist_audio_features('ed sheeran')

Pop_2010 <-
pop_2010 %>% 
    select(energy, danceability, speechiness, tempo) %>%
    summarize(mean_energy = mean(energy), 
              mean_danceability = mean(danceability),
              mean_speechiness = mean(speechiness),
              mean_tempo = mean(tempo)) %>% 
    mutate(years= "2010s")
```

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
Pop_1990_2010 <- rbind(Pop_1990, Pop_2010) %>% 
                select(years, mean_energy, mean_danceability, mean_speechiness,
                      mean_tempo)

paged_table(Pop_1990_2010)
```

1990's pop has more energy and more tempo then 2010's but is less danceable and uses fewer words.

### Rap

Let's do the same with the rap genre of the 2000's and that of the 2010's.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rap_2000 <- get_artist_audio_features('eminem')

Rap_2000 <-
rap_2000 %>% 
    select(energy, danceability, speechiness, tempo) %>%
    summarize(mean_energy = mean(energy), 
              mean_danceability = mean(danceability),
              mean_speechiness = mean(speechiness),
              mean_tempo = mean(tempo)) %>% 
    mutate(years= "2000s")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rap_2010 <- get_artist_audio_features('ed sheeran')

Rap_2010 <-
rap_2010 %>% 
    select(energy, danceability, speechiness, tempo) %>%
    summarize(mean_energy = mean(energy), 
              mean_danceability = mean(danceability),
              mean_speechiness = mean(speechiness),
              mean_tempo = mean(tempo)) %>% 
    mutate(years= "2010s")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, layout="l-body-outset"}
Rap_2000_2010 <- rbind(Rap_2000, Rap_2010) %>% 
                select(years, mean_energy, mean_danceability, mean_speechiness,
                      mean_tempo)

paged_table(Rap_2000_2010)
```
Rap from the 2000s and from the 2010s have similar danceabilities and tempos. However, 2010's rap is much less energetic and uses much less words than 2000's rap.

## Music is life

Music is evolving the same way our life is. The music our parents listened to is radically different from what we listen to now. Music is a fingerprint of our taste and is able to capture the essence of what makes each decade so special! Grab your phone and your headphones and enjoy some great music!
